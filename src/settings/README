Instead of a settings.py file, we are gonna use a whole settings package.

This packages contains:

* base.py : Base settings, common in development and production mode
* devel.py : Development mode specific settings
* prod.py : Production mode specific settings

* local_settings.template : If you need special environment settings on your development machine,
    create a local_settings.py file and put this special settings there.
    This file is a mere suggestion of what should be in a local_settings.py

* secret.py : This file contains special security keys (like AWS keys, etc)


Important:
    local_settings.py and secret.py are not stored by git (see .gitignore on the project root)
    for obvious reasons (local customization and security).
